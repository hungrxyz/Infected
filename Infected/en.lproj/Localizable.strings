However, the two data sets contain different data and serve different purposes. For LCPS it is important to have insight into the number of required and occupied COVID and non-COVID beds in hospitals. The LCPS therefore has a capacity perspective and for this uses aggregated information collected by the RCPSs. For the NICE it is important to have insight into the number of (new) COVID-19 patients per day in the ICU and in the clinic and use data at patient level (BSN) for this. The figures from the NICE and the LCPS cannot therefore be directly compared with each other, as these figures relate to other concepts (patient vs occupation) and are not obtained continuously but with fixed snapshots. In addition, the status of the patient (\"still suspicious\" or \"no longer positive\") can lead to differences. For more information about NICE, see the NICE website (www.stichting-nice.nl). â€” LCPS (Translated from Dutch by Google Translate)";
